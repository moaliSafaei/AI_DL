## Predicting Housing Prices: A Practical Example
In this illustrative example, we delve into predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. Our dataset comprises various features related to housing, including the crucial “Price” column. Let’s break down the steps involved:

Data Collection and Exploration:

We begin by gathering data on housing attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors.
Next, we explore the dataset, checking for missing values, outliers, and potential correlations.
Correlation Matrix:

Constructing a correlation matrix helps us understand the relationships between different features. It provides insights into which variables influence housing prices the most.
By visualizing the matrix, we can identify strong positive or negative correlations.
Data Preprocessing:

Before training our model, we need to preprocess the data.
This involves splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets. We allocate 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.
Additionally, we apply the MinMaxScaler function to normalize the features, ensuring consistent scaling across all variables.
Neural Network Architecture:

Our neural network consists of two hidden layers, each with an arbitrary number of neurons.
We choose the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for its effectiveness in handling non-linearities.
The optimizer is set to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a popular choice for training neural networks.
Hyperparameters:

We experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize our model’s performance.
Specifically, we explore two learning rates: 0.1 and 0.001.
Additionally, we vary the number of epochs, considering both 20 and 4000 epochs.
Toolset:

To implement our model, we rely on Keras for building the neural network architecture.
For visualization, we utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn, powerful libraries for creating informative plots and graphs.
In summary, this example demonstrates the essential steps in predicting housing prices. By following these procedures and fine-tuning our model, we can make accurate predictions and enhance decision-making in real estate markets.
